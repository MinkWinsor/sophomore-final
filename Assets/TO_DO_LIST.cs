/*
 
 Final Project

Develop a new game in Unity that is unlike anything demonstrated in class. Most importantly write short clean and well documented scripts

 

Help provided: The instruction will be limited to:

    Demonstrating Components of Unity
    Syntax of Scripting
    Elements of Scripting
    Elaborating on Concepts and Principles 

 

Students are responsibility:

    Writing scripts
    Solving Problems
    Documenting scripts for easy searching
    Inventing gameplay

 

Minimum Project Requirements:

    4 Action delegates, 3 passing data //Done, but only 2 pass data so far.
    4 coroutines //Spawner, Crashing, 
    2 Instances of Inheritance //Done
    2 Instances of interfaces //Done
    3 Uses of Polymorphism
    2 Uses of Overloading //Many times, especially in Unit inheritance.
    5 different Mono Behaviors
    2 lists using Add() and other methods
    Use of Functions that Return values
    Use of Functions with parameters
    Use of Static Variables
    Use of Static Functions 
    2 Switch Statements
    2 Whiles loops
    2 For Loops

16. 2 Foreach Loops

 

Project Restrictions:

Points withdrawn for use of:

    Scripts repeat without the use of functions or loops
    Update more that once in the game
    GameObject.Find or any related, or similar Methods
    The use of “else if” more that once in an if statement rather than a switch statement
